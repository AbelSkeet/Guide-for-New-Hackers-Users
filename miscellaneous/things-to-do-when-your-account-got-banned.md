## VAC bans

Before reading this page, you should check out the ![types of game bans at here](../.gitbook/assets/game-bans.md), which will cover most types of VAC bans. In short when your account is banned, you cannot:

* Play on VAC-secured servers in the game you have been banned,
* Cannot trade items on the game you have been banned.

## What can I do for it?

In short, there is nothing you can do when a game account got banned. However, you can still use a ![batch file](https://pastebin.com/KBCAf2Xt) which can helps you to remove all the steam account's data on your PC.

If you are raging with expensive inventory, it is highly recommend to transfer your inventory to a unlinked account.
