# Pastes and scams

These are some cheats that have been identified as scams, which you should just stay away from them.

## Ezfrags

Ezfrags is technically not a paste, but with it's high detection it is not recommended to use.

Plus please do not buy Ezfrag's premium subscription, since it is just the same as Ezfrag's free version, but ironically it has a highly detection rate than the free version. So just stay away from both Ezfrag's plan.

## SmurfWrecker

SmurfWrecker is pasted heavily and is very detected, so you should stay away from it.

Both the Pro and Basic plans are terrible, and the 'legit' you can do with it is terrible, so please do not use it!

## Static-Ware

Static-Ware is literally just renamed SmurfWrecker, they didn't even change the watermark so please don't use it.

## VeteranCheats

Just a shameless cash grab that is probably pasted, has little features and is most likely detected so DO NOT USE.

## SkyCheats

Another shameless cash grab with little features, most likely renamed VeteranCheats so please stay away from it.

## time2win

Renamed VeteranCheats, as usual just a cash grab made by some kids so DO NOT BUY ANY SUBSCRIBTIONS FROM THEM.

## Battlelog

VeteranCheats, this is getting kind of annoying...

## Daxhack

Promoted by shady people, obviously a paste of osiris. Dev puts no effort into the project at all. Filled with alot of broken features

## Project Infinity

Project Infinity also has a free version, but since it has been identified as a paste and having a terrible detection rate, we do not recommend you to try it out, despite for some reason a lot of youtubers have chosen it to demostrate how CSGO cheating looks like.

## DarkAim

A jme paste, same dev that works on Abyss, InsanityCheats and used to work on Redeye Cheats, dev has sold pastes before, vac detected and receives nearly zero updates.

## InsanityCheats

A jme paste, same dev that works on Abyss, Darkaim and used to work on Redeye Cheats, dev has sold pastes before, sometimes vac detected and receives some updates. The staff team is alot better with this one out of the jme pastes.

## IWantCheats

Lying about permanent detections in multiple games.

## Singularity.wtf

Fake-Reviews, Fake-Infos

Little features for the price, dev couldn't give two flying ducks about the cheat \(thats why its pasted\), detected often and make sure to stay away from the free cheat as its so broken and nearly as detected as ezfrags.

## Omniaim

Bought their loader off of someone, Staff don't care about the cheat at all, Rarely receives updates and it's detected quite often.

## 5dollarcheats

Fake-Reviews, Vac detected very often and the dev doesn't care about the project.

## Redeye Cheats

Used to be a jme paste, Used to have the dev that worked on Darkaim, InsanityCheats and Abyss, Previous dev has sold pastes before, Now has a new dev but its still paste, not a very good detection record and they've tried to redeem themselves but its still pasted with a few of its features being broken.

## abyss.gg

A jme paste, same dev that works on Darkaim, InsanityCheats used to work on RedeyeCheats, Dev has sold pastes before, Vac detection issues, Receives nearly zero updates and a non-existent staff team/a team that doesn't care.

## ayyware

Basically an outdated open-source cheat.

## Controversial Section!

* This section describes a highly controversial event/item that may subject to change, you should NOT take this as an absolute reference. By reading the following section, you are agreeing that r/csgohacks and CSGO cheating masterguide contributors will not bear any reponsibility for any misleading information.

Zapped.cc is a highly controversial cheat provider that has been claimed to leaking it's user's ip address, causing user's online privacy might be compromised. Also according to [Boring](pastes-and-scams.md), a famous cheating youtuber, who has pointed out several evidence about zapped that it is a scam. However since we cannot validate the accuracy of his sources, we are still unable to give a conclusion as of right now, but until then it will still be on the paste and scam list.

## TODO Section
